# MPS Acceleration for Jarvis Voice Generation

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of MPS (Metal Performance Shaders) acceleration for the Jarvis MCP voice generation system. MPS is Apple's framework for GPU-accelerated computing on Apple Silicon Macs, providing significant performance improvements for machine learning tasks.

## Performance Benefits

Based on our testing, MPS acceleration provides approximately **2.06x faster** voice generation compared to CPU-only processing. This results in more responsive voice feedback after task completion.

| Device | Average Generation Time | Speedup |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ------- |
| CPU    | 90.74 seconds           | 1.0x    |
| MPS    | 43.96 seconds           | 2.06x   |

## Implementation Details

The following changes were made to implement MPS acceleration:

1. **Voice Generator Script (`src/voice_generator.py`)**:

   - Added device detection to use MPS when available
   - Added fallback to CPU when MPS is not available
   - Added `--force-cpu` option to force CPU usage even when MPS is available
   - Increased model loading timeout from 30 to 60 seconds

2. **MCP Server (`src/index.ts`)**:

   - Added MPS environment variable to the command execution
   - Increased audio generation timeout from 30 to 60 seconds

3. **Performance Testing**:
   - Created `simple-performance-test.py` for basic performance comparison
   - Created `test-performance.py` for comprehensive performance testing
   - Created `test-mps-jarvis.sh` for direct testing of MPS acceleration

## Usage

MPS acceleration is automatically enabled when running the Jarvis MCP on Apple Silicon Macs. No additional configuration is required.

To force CPU-only mode (e.g., for troubleshooting), you can modify the command in `src/index.ts` to remove the `PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK=1` environment variable.

## Technical Notes

1. **MPS Fallback**: We use the `PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK=1` environment variable to enable fallback to CPU for operations not supported by MPS.

2. **Device Selection**: The voice generator script automatically selects the appropriate device:

   ```python
   if torch.backends.mps.is_available():
       device = "mps"
   else:
       device = "cpu"
   ```

3. **Timeout Handling**: We increased the timeout for model loading and audio generation to accommodate the initial loading time on MPS.

## Future Improvements

1. **Model Caching**: Implement model caching to avoid reloading the model for each generation, which could further improve performance.

2. **Batch Processing**: Explore batch processing for multiple voice generation requests to better utilize MPS acceleration.

3. **Quantization**: Investigate model quantization to reduce memory usage and potentially improve performance.

## Conclusion

MPS acceleration provides a significant performance improvement for Jarvis voice generation on Apple Silicon Macs. By leveraging the GPU capabilities of Apple Silicon, we can generate voice responses more than twice as fast compared to CPU-only processing, leading to a more responsive user experience.
